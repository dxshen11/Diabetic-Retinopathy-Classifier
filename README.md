This repo contains the dataset, code, notebook, and report used to develop a diabetic retinopathy classifier based on Antal and Hajdu's 2014 paper describing the development of a classifier for the MESSIDOR database. The project was completed as part of a final course project for BIOENGR C275 at UCLA, a graduate level course on machine learning in bioengineering.
